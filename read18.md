Django is a web frame work to make the programming easier 

A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

The basics:

~~~
django.db.models.Model.
~~~

To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.
~~~
from django.urls import path

Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes
As with all open source projects, the two major issues that crop up are funding and control. Let’s start with funding: why does an open-source project need funding?
It turns out that while writing code is fun and developers are generally willing to contribute their time for free to do so there are a host of decidedly less fun tasks needed to maintain and sustain an open source project


opular open source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:
1. Corporate Sponsor 
2. Solo
3. Non-profit

## Django Software Foundation
The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.

## Technical Organization

Django followed Python’s model of having a Benevolent Dictator for Life, that is, a project founder who retained final say for disputes/arguments within the community.
and they have a team for django
