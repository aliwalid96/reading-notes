## Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm
1. O(1):describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time
2. O(N):describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
3. O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 
4. O(2^N):denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
