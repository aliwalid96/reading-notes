# whiteboard inerview

practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview. This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apart.

## Communicate
its from the most important thing is cumunicate an ask the interviwee questions 

ways to comunicate 
1. First, Restate the Question

Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation

The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand. There is no situation in which restating the problem will hurt you — it shows you can articulate a problem and gives you time to think it through a bit while you discuss

2. Ask About Edge Cases

Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them


3. Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic
4. Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

5. You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code.
