# Dunder Methods
n Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores
and clled magic methods 
## Special Methods and the Python Data Model

This elegant design is known as the Python data model and lets developers tap into rich language features like sequences, iteration, operator overloading, attribute access

## Object Initialization: __init__(the cunstroctor )

To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder

## Object Representation: __str__, __repr__

what will happeb=n when we print the object the __str__and __erpewill display how it will printed

## Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__


Dunder methods to the rescue! It only takes a little bit of code to make the class iterable:

To iterate over transactions in reversed order you can implement the __reversed__ special method:

def __reversed__(self):
    return self[::-1]

## Operator Overloading for Merging
 Python, everything is an object. We are completely fine adding two integers or two strings with the + (plus) operator, it behaves in expected ways


 
Let’s implement __add__ to be able to merge two accounts. The expected behavior would be to merge all attributes together: the owner name, as well as starting amounts and transactions. To do this we can benefit from the iteration support we implemented earlier

Yes, it is a bit more involved than the other dunder implementations so far. It should show you though that you are in the driver’s seat. You can implement addition however you please. If we wanted to ignore historic transactions—fine

## Callable Python Objects: __call__

You can make an object callable like a regular function by adding the __call__ dunder method. 

## Context Manager Support and the With Statement: __enter__, __exit__

A context manager is a simple “protocol” (or interface) that your object needs to follow so it can be used with the with statement. Basically all you need to do is add __enter__ and __exit__ methods to an object if you want it to function as a context manager.

# Basic Statistics in Python — Probability

probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?

### From statistics to probability
ur data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads 
 
````import random
def coin_trial():
heads = 0
for i in range(100):
    if random.random() <= 0.5:
        heads +=1
    return heads
def simulate(n):
    trials = []
    for i in range(n):
        trials.append(coin_trial())
    return(sum(trials)/n)
simulate(10)
>>> 5.4
simulate(100)
>>> 4.83
simulate(1000)
>>> 5.055
simulate(1000000)
>>> 4.999781```


The data and the distribution

Before we can tackle the question of “which wine is better than average,” we have to mind the nature of our data.



The most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape. We’ve been calling it a distribution
