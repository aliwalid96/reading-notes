The random module provides access to functions that support many operations.

We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, 
### randint
If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number

### suffle 
The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.


## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test

using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

Risk Assessment
In the risk analysis process, these steps prove to be the most important one. It is said that this step is way too complex and should be tackled with the utmost care. After risk identification, assessment has to be dealt programmatically.
#### If you make a certain level of coverage a target, people will try to attain it. The trouble is that high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing.

Like most aspects of programming, testing requires thoughtfulness. TDD is a very useful, but certainly not sufficient, tool to help you get good tests. If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s.

## big O notation 
is how much time we expect the program will take and when we calculat it give value like O(n)
